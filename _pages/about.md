Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities](https://gardnercenter.stanford.edu). I currently serve on the editorial boards of the [American Educational Research Journal](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/aer), [the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15206688), and [Education Finance and Policy](https://direct.mit.edu/edfp) and as an Associate Editor at [Economic Inquiry](https://weai.org/journals/view/EI).

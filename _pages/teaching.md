[What Works in Education?](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&q=EDUC+225%3A+What+Works+in+Education%3F&collapse=) (EDUC 225), Stanford University, Fall 2023

What are the most promising, evidence-based strategies for realizing student potential and improving school performance? This course engages this question, beginning with (1) the current U.S. policy context (2) a discussion of the research methods, measures, and resources commonly used to examine what works, and (3) critical perspectives on the "what works" movement. We will also discuss strategies for efficiently and effectively organizing research evidence, projecting this evidence onto specific education challenges, and presenting this analysis in an actionable manner.

[Quasi-Experimental Research Designs and Analysis](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&q=EDUC430B) (EDUC 430B), Stanford University, Winter 2023

This course surveys quantitative methods to make causal inferences in the absence of randomized experiment including the use of natural and quasi-experiments, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, fixed effects estimators, and difference-in-differences. We emphasize the proper interpretation of these research designs and critical engagement with their key assumptions for applied researchers.

In this seminar, students develop the foundational knowledge and skills for effective partnership research. This seminar introduces students to the skills and knowledge necessary for starting and sustaining partnership research through readings and discussion. In the seminar, students develop a concept for partnership research they want to pursue and receive coaching and guidance on forming and nurturing a partnership research project.
